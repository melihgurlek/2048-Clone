# 2048-Clone

A recreation of 2048, fully coded in C++.
Main reason of this project was to see how game development works and to practice C++ since it's been a long time since i've done any C++ practice.
It probably isn't the most optimized code.
Mechanics.cpp and Mechanics.h is mainly for game mechanics and how game works. Game.h and Game.cpp is also mostly about that part. Other parts are mostly for the visual side.
I can see few features to implement and to improve the code. We'll see.
